## AnSwitch
This is a simple web component - switch. I implement Andrew's [Yet another toggle animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/2309834-Yet-another-toggle-animation)

__DEMO__

#### Usage
~~~html
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="answitch">
	<div class="circle">
		<div class="an-line an-left"></div>
		<div class="an-line an-right"></div>
	</div>
</div>
~~~
And you need to include `AnSwitch.css` file. I set the width and height to 2/1(200px/100px). You could set .answitch's width and height with any value, but just keep the radio.
